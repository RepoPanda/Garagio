# Garagio

## Description

Our motivation for this project was to practice and learn to use the MERN paradigm in a full-stack application. We built a e-commerce site that allows users to cycle through private garage sale postings. Users can create an account, login, and post items for sale. Users can also view items for sale and make a purchase.
